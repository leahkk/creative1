        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Leah, and I've been cooking since I was at least ten years-old. My parents didn't
          buy many sweets, so once I learned that I could make chocolate chip cookies, I would make them
          weekly. I did that for many years, and eventually decided that I wanted to get into baking in
          general.<br/><br/> Cupcakes were really popular at one time during my teenage years, so I tried those out
          for a while. After moving out of my parent's house, I was forced to step out of my comfort zone
          and try out more <em>"useful"</em> cooking, like making dinner and breakfast, etc. I found out that
          I loved it! Not only could I make whatever dessert I wanted, I realized that I also could make
          <em>delicious</em> meals that I would eat everyday! (Because you gotta eat everyday.)<br/><br/>

          Most of the things I've gotten into, such as making wedding cakes, have happened out of a rash
          decision to try something for a friend. And it has worked out so far! I think people are holding
          themselves back when it comes to cooking. You don't have to go out to eat if you want something fancy,
          the <em>fanciest (and most inexpensive) meal can be made by you!</em> I hope to educate the whole world one
          day about the health benefits, and life benefits in general that come from making your own food.
